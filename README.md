## My history with programming

>I started programming in 2020 in LUA, i didn't know much, but i could make some scripts for Roblox with LUA. I stopped programming in LUA after about 4 months. So in May of this year, someone created a tiktok sharing bot, and luckily, a tiktok video of me talking about the bot was successful, so i managed to create a "community" . With this community, i started to make some tools in Batch, and i started to delve deeper into Batch Script. But i wanted to give up on the idea because Batch Script is not a very optimizable way to create programs. So i decided to create a roblox cheat just for fun, and I started to learn LUA more than i used to, then i learned to create advanced exploits that handled game events. But recently, i wanted to create a bot for Discord, so i decided to learn Python, so i was able to have a considerable understanding of Python, being able to program raid bots and Rest API
